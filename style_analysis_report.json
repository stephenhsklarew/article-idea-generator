      "Years ago, I was working for a company that launched a marketplace for corporate training courses. Each new customer required a tailored conversation with a company representative who would compile a personalized curriculum based on their needs. They were eager to implement a smart AI recommendation engine to reduce their workload so they could scale more efficiently. However, there was one glaring problem: they didn’t have a lot of customer data. Few records of purchase histories, company profiles, and marketplace browsing behavior. The AI engine was limited in its recommendations because there simply wasn’t enough data.",
      "This experience culminated in one of the most important lessons I’ve learned in AI: the quantity and quality of your data is the ultimate limiting factor. No matter how good your AI models are, without plentiful and good data, they can’t do their job. Data is more than just fuel for AI; it’s the very foundation everything else is built on."

      "For the past several years, my team and I have worked on a project modernizing a legacy disease management system for the State of Michigan’s public health department. Before our project began, the director of the State’s Health and Human Services (HHS) regularly struggled with the reality of a 20-year-old legacy system: poor user experience and system performance, aging infrastructure, and costly support and maintenance. This all came to a head in March 2020 with the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Shortly after the pandemic was declared, the HHS Director expanded his team in an effort to quickly get ahead of the outbreak. The legacy system couldn’t cope with increased user and data loads, and the surging number of volunteer users couldn’t figure out how to properly use it. Faced with rising demands and growing inefficiencies, he took the plunge and chose to modernize the system rather than continue paying for costly, patchwork upgrades, finally setting a course to retire what had become a classic Rube Goldberg machine."

The trainer gave me a diet plan and a daily 1,800-calorie target—plus homework: log everything I ate for a week. Tracking meals turned out to be a hassle, even when using top apps like MyFitnessPal. In fact, I found the app clunkier than a pen and paper food journal. At the time, ChatGPT just launched custom GPTs with computer vision features, so I started experimenting."

      "Case in point, a manufacturing client of ours wanted a “quick fix” to a sales forecast the last vendor built but no one used. We urged meeting the people who rely on the forecast upfront; the response was “just improve the model.” Tests looked great: better features, cleaner data, lower error, yet adoption didn’t budge. After go‑live, the real issue surfaced: the user interface didn’t fit how revenue leaders prefer to review demand, controls felt foreign, and graphs lagged. The model wasn’t the blocker; lack of focus on the user experience was."
